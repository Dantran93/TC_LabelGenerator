# TC_LabelGenerator
A side project for the Tucson Cactus and Koi company that automates their label creation for their inventory.
The program reads an excel file for inventory which includes 100+ different species of plants, and generates
XML files that follow the style of label they use with the DYMO Label printer.

This process used to consume an entire work day or more for multiple employees. Now it only requires one
employee to run the program to generate every label in seconds.
